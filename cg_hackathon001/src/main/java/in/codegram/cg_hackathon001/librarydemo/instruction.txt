Imagine that you are working on a library management app. 
In this app, members can get the books issued. 
We have a data of books which are issued by members. 
Your job is to find out the average number of books that are issued in a month by library members. 

Follow the below instructions to attempt this exercise.
1. Create a Person class
2. Keep id, name, books_issued fields in Person class.
3. Create a parameterized constructor in Person class, and you must have getters for all fields. 
4. Create a LibraryDemo class with main method
5. Use below table for further reference.
6. Make sure to use modular approach.

-----------Persons data---------------------------------------
Person[] persons=new Person[]{
new Person(101,"pankaj",3),
new Person(102,"vikas",2),
new Person(103,"vineet",3),
new Person(104,"akash",1),
new Person(105,"shalini",0),
new Person(106,"shikha",1),
new Person(108,"prateek",3)
};

----------Get only books_issued number-----------------------------
private int[] getBooksIssued(Person[] persons){
//TODO: Write your logic here
return null;
}

-----------------Find the average books issued by all members------------------
private int findAvgBookIssued(int[] books_issued){
//TODO: Write your logic here
}
